# Hello!
I am Ashy ([Discord](https://discord.com/users/1340936652197199943): bronuz0167), a degenerate Youtube shorts browser.

I have been scrolling smoothly until i encounter AI channels/zero comment shorts. Now I'm making a database listing every single
obstacle I have encountered.

Good luck using it whatever way you want.

# How to use this?
Check out [probe.txt](https://github.com/Boxibous/youtube-lq-database/blob/main/probe.txt)

Any line starts with a `;` is intended to be a comment.

There's currently a few section of it, for example, AI generated, bot commenters, low viewerbase creators,...

Contribute by opening a Pull request. They will get approved after checked.
# How to get removed? I'm a human/I want to grow my viewerbase

Just DM [Ashy](https://discord.com/users/1340936652197199943) on Discord, ~~or open an issue on my dedicated GitHub repo~~

(coming soon)
